# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build something in nim (1.4.2). I looked interesting to experiment with.

## Build

    nim c students.nim

This will create a file called `students` in the root directory. Run with:

    ./students

## Evaluation

I did not finish this program as I could not figure out how to make it work a 100% as intended. Nim really looks interesting at first. Has a lot of documentation and looks like it also offers OO but in reality it is not a true OO language. You can make data structures and link methods to those structures so that it kind of looks like OO.
Why the program does not work as I inteded I had trouble debugging it. I looks like it should work; As I am not super familiar with this language I tried looking at examples but I could not find one that might hint what I was doing wrong.
